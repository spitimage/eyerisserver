# Eyeris Server
This is the new home for the Eyeris server project.

## What is Eyeris?
Eyeris is a prototype/demo system that I built back in 2011. I have always __hated__ passwords, so Eyeris was my attempt to try something new and shop the idea around. You can get a basic overview by looking at some old slideware notes [here](https://github.com/spitimage/eyeris/wiki). It's a very ambitious project, and I enjoyed playing around with it. Since then, it has moved from back burner to junk drawer. After nearly forgetting about it, I am now releasing it - _who knows what may happen?_ If there is any interest, I'd be happy to add more documentation or otherwise re-engage.

## Contents
This project contains all the server-side code. This includes:

* Django application and some tests
* EC2 setup and deployment (using fab)
* Python-based QR code generation stuff

## The Client
The Android client side of the Eyeris system can be found [here](https://github.com/spitimage/eyeris).
